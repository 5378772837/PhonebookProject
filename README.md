# PhonebookProject
Fun little console project I did during the Claim Academy Bootcamp. 
It has menus, does logic, catches bad input, and takes junk data and cleans it up. 

We obviously moved on to CRUD operations and rest APIs with Java, Maven, Hibernate, MySQL, React, CSS, and HTML
but this was one of my early favorites. It was a lot of fun!
